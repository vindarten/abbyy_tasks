# Algorithmic tasks from ABBYY
## Task 1
Reverse a singly linked list in linear time and constant extra memory.

## Task 2
An array of length n - 1 contains all numbers from 0 to n, except two. Find these numbers in linear time and constant extra memory.

## Compilation
```
make
```
or
```
make task1
make task2
```

## Usage
```
./bin/task1 ./data/task1/test1.txt
./bin/task2 ./data/task2/test1.txt [-xor]
```
-xor - using the xor algorithm for searching

You can find tests for each task in the directory "./data".
